1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,195
We talked a bit about end-to-end encryption already, and

2
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:05,625
a lot of the assumption is that

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,515
we have some kind of symmetric key that we can use to talk privately.

4
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,475
So you and me have some kind of secret key and we use that to talk securely.

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:14,575
Diffie-Hellman is how we get that secret key.

6
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:19,995
Diffie-Hellman was first published in

7
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,275
1976 and has become

8
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:25,415
pretty much a staple for any kind of cryptography at all.

9
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:29,095
Whenever we use cryptography, we usually need to have a symmetric key

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,745
and to get that, we often

11
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:34,055
have to perform some kind of Diffie-Hellman. It's so prevalent

12
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,795
that your phone is probably doing it right now.

13
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,815
Right - when you logged on to the browser to watch this video,

14
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:41,125
you performed a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,085
When you open up your phone and it connects to any server,

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,205
it'll almost certainly perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

17
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:50,195
If not now, then in the next few minutes, right?

18
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:53,075
It's unbelievably important and unbelievably common.
The problem with Diffie-Hellman

19
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,285
is it's quite mathematically complex.

20
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:58,075
It depends on your level of mathematics, so what I've thought we do is,

21
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,825
I thought we cover the mathematics in the Extra Bits and then we'd

22
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:03,765
look at a kind of example of what actually happens

23
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,055
as an overview for those people who're just

24
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:09,035
not interested in the mathematics because they don't need to implement it and they don't really

25
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,055
mind.
Ehm, so we'll do both and in that way, hopefully,

26
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,825
there's something for everyone.
We shall see.

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,705
So perhaps Diffie-Hellman key exchange is slightly misnamed in the sense that

28
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:20,235
what we don't actually do is

29
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,405
exchange a key.
Because then it would be out

30
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:25,405
in the public and we'd see it.
What we actually do is exchange

31
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:28,395
some public variables and we combine them with some private

32
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:31,555
variables we've kept hidden, so that we can both create the same key.

33
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:34,955
Right, so we're actually creating a key together, in some sense.

34
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:38,135
So, as always, we'll go back to Alice and Bob for this.

35
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:41,165
So, let's have Alice over here,

36
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:43,695
and Bob over here.
I'm gonna sort of spread this out a bit because we're

37
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:47,105
gonna be putting these in and I don't wanna run out of space.
So Alice and Bob are here,

38
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:49,395
these are their own machines and this

39
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:52,925
is a kind of public area.
So anything

40
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,835
that Alice and Bob send to each other or agree on in public

41
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:58,635
is gonna be in this area.
So as an attacker, if we

42
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,635
want to break this key exchange, if we want to find out what the secret key is,

43
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,475
we have to do these variables to do it, right?

44
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:07,955
And that, hopefully, will explain why that's difficult to do.

45
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:11,385
Okay. So, the first thing is

46
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,825
right at the beginning of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Alice and Bob

47
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:17,635
will have to agree to some mathematical parameters that they're going to use.

48
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:20,495
This is a value "g", or generator,

49
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,835
and a big prime number "n", right. Now

50
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:26,905
for this example I'm gonna try and use colour mixing to try and explain

51
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,765
this. I'm gonna write the letters in as well.

52
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:32,465
n won't have a colour, for the sake of this analogy.

53
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,525
g does. So g is gonna be, ehm, let's go

54
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,385
with yellow.
Right now, I'm gonna sort of squirt this in and

55
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:41,175
hope that it doesn't go everywhere.
In fact, we kinda need two copies of g, really.

56
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:43,475
So let's just sort of fill it up here.

57
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:46,355
Up to about... I wanna get them the same.

58
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:49,225
So far so good, so far it's not all over my desk.

59
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,225
Alright, close enough. Alright.

60
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:54,025
Ehm, well it's kind of yellowy.

61
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:57,015
Often, they're shared at the very beginning of the handshake.

62
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,115
Sometimes, they're just embedded in the standard

63
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,135
or everyone always uses the same one.
It depends on the

64
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:04,925
situation. Ehm, it can take a little time

65
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,975
and an extra message to send these things across, so sometimes having them

66
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:11,035
stashed ahead of time is a good idea.
So we got g,

67
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,095
right, this is g.
Now, Alice,

68
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,755
to begin with, needs to calculate a private key,

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,940
or private variable.
I'm gonna choose red for Alice.

70
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,700
Here we go. I probably could have used more food colour than this kind of pale red.

71
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,815
Is that red? Yeah, close enough.
(To Brady) What do you think?

72
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:27,805
Brady: It's rose-coloured.

73
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,525
Mike: Now Bob is gonna do the same thing, he's gonna have a private value that is going to be blue.

74
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,155
Now, I haven't chosen very interesting colours.
That's simply because

75
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:37,365
there aren't that many colours available in the shops for food colouring.

76
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:40,665
Ehm, and I didn't go to that much effort.
There we go, that's blue.

77
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:44,205
Now, these two colours are in their private area.

78
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:47,165
This is "a" [red] and this is "b" [blue], so I'm gonna label these.

79
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:50,245
This is little a, this is little b.
Now, the important thing is that these are never shared

80
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:52,255
with anyone. Alice doesn't share this with the public;

81
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,745
Alice doesn't share this with Bob.
Now the first thing that happens is

82
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,835
that we need to combine the private key with the generator [g]

83
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,755
to produce a public key.

84
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:03,915
Now the point is that, once we combined them we can't

85
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:05,405
unmix it, right, that's why

86
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:08,795
people like to use this colour analogy - once we pour two colours together,

87
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,155
it's difficult to know what colours went in.

88
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:15,075
Because, yes, so if I poor red into yellow it maybe makes

89
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:18,355
orange, but it could be that it was a bit more yellow and a bit less red.

90
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:21,055
Or, you know, it's difficult to know.
So there's kind of

91
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,825
orange for Alice and Bob's gonna take

92
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:27,045
his blue, we kinda need them to be the same level really,

93
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,395
and it does kind of make green.
This is a bit orangy -

94
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:34,485
let's not critique me too much.
So, yeah, they're very different to the originals

95
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:37,295
and the important thing is that we don't know

96
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:40,435
what went into here, right?
We know g,

97
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:43,355
but we don't know a and we can't find out.

98
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:46,345
So this is actually, this public key here

99
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:49,395
is "ag", in some sense.
It's got an a in it, it's got a g in it.

100
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:52,285
This one has got a b in it

101
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:55,675
and it's got a g in it, and we can't extract

102
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:59,155
the a's, we cannot reverse this process.

103
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:02,535
Now, they then are gonna exchange these public variables,

104
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,045
but keep the private ones back.

105
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:08,225
So, we're gonna sort of draw an arrow over here

106
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,305
and an arrow over here and they're gonna switch them like

107
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,275
this.
So they get sent out in clear text-

108
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:17,155
These are now in the public area because they've been

109
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:20,215
sent in plain text, everyone's seen them.

110
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,875
So now, as an attacker I know

111
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:26,115
bg, or Bobs public part of this key,

112
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:28,665
ag, Alices public component,

113
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,745
and g and n, right?
I don't know anything else.

114
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:33,065
I don't know what a and b are.

115
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:36,205
Now, this is the final part of Diffie-Hellman.
It's not actually

116
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,135
very long.
You can do all this in just three messages.

117
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,365
Alice is going to take the public component that Bob sent her

118
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:45,315
and add her private key.

119
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:48,035
And Bob is gonna take Alices public component and add his

120
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:51,055
private key, so we're going to get,

121
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,995
in essence, a mixture of

122
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:56,275
a and b and g, right?
That's the idea.

123
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:59,335
So let's do that now.
Brady: So is that in the private domain?

124
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:02,565
Mike: Uhm, yes, this will be done privately because these are never exchanged.

125
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:05,695
So these go into the private domain now,
I mean I could make a copy of them,

126
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:06,695
let's not.

127
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,025
So Alice is gonna add her red in,

128
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:11,645
so let's go, let's just add some red up to about there -

129
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:14,775
doesn't really work because the red is really faint.
And then

130
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,085
Bob adds in his blue

131
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,335
which is gonna be like

132
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,805
that.

133
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:24,755
And hopefully, this is where it all doesn't work

134
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:27,675
or does work, these two values are kind of the same.

135
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:30,615
I mean they're not; they're pretty close.

136
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,435
That's a little bit darker, perhaps because the blue is a little bit stronger.

137
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,995
(Brady) Considering you've done that without actually measuring something -

138
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:39,055
(Mike) Yeah. I mean obviously, you would do this normally with mathematical -

139
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,185
err, mathematics -

140
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,665
mathematical functions that are much more precise than my random squirting

141
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:44,945
of liquids.

142
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,415
Now, -
(Brady) So those two are now in the private -

143
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:51,425
(Mike) These? Yeah, this is private.
So Alice has taken Bobs bg

144
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:54,155
and added her a, so that gets

145
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:57,205
"abg"; and Bob takes

146
00:06:57,225 --> 00:07:00,085
Alices ag and gets "abg"

147
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,965
by putting his b in there.

148
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,875
Right. Now the order doesn't matter.
Remember, just like mixing colours, the mathematics

149
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,925
is such that adding b first to g and then

150
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:11,915
we add in a is the same as adding a first.
So these two values

151
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,775
are exactly the same.
If you wanted to try and

152
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:16,225
re-create this as an attacker,

153
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:18,495
you can't do it.
Because you have

154
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:22,025
ag and bg and g.

155
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,915
And, so you could mix these two together, and you'd

156
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,925
get "abgg", in some sense.

157
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:31,095
Mathematically, this is a little bit... tenuous

158
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,095
but we'll talk about that in the Extra Bits.
The point is, nothing in this public area can be combined

159
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,495
in any way to get

160
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:39,545
this value or this value, which are the same.

161
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:42,575
The only way to do that is to find out what a and b are,

162
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:45,325
and the only way to do that is to split up one of these two

163
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:48,405
public components, which is very, very difficult to do.

164
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:51,375
Alright. And that's what's so cool about Diffie-Hellman.
In a few messages,

165
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,675
we've sent some public

166
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:56,155
numbers around and

167
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:59,535
we've used our private numbers to get a shared secret that noone else can know.

168
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:00,845
Ehm, now you'd

169
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:03,655
generally do this at the beginning of every conversation,

170
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:06,365
and you would use this number combined with

171
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:09,695
perhaps some session variables or something like this to

172
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,585
derive secret keys to use in things like AES.

173
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,715
So this is actually just gonna be a number which will then hash

174
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,245
to turn into an AES key or something like that.

175
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,725
Now, the mathematics behind Diffie-Hellman is,

176
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,065
usually, modular arithmetics.

177
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:28,255
Recall that we have our public numbers g and n;

178
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,015
g is often very small - it's usually a small prime number:

179
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:34,105
n is often very big and needs to be big for the security

180
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:36,794
of this to work.
n is often 2,000 bits long,

181
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:39,474
or 4,000 bits is more common now.
