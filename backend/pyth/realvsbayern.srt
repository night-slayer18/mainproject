1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,080
ooh so a penalty each ends in a draw 22

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,560
the final score in Munich with the

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
deciding leg still to come in Madrid

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
what a cracking game that is going to be

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,559
next week uh thoughts anybody I just

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:13,040
thought it was an outstanding game if I

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,519
was being totally honest K I think T

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,080
wanted to see the tactics of Bayern I

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,720
think it was pretty much what he said I

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,279
think the Tactical change changing the

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,279
Wingers to other sides and going more

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,199
inside really helped injection of pace

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,039
but Real Madrid find a way to stay in

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,920
the game again for the first 20 minutes

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,280
it was out the game it was all Bayern

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,600
Munich but in the end they just managed

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,239
to do it and that man vishous J we've

18
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,000
talked about Bellum so many times we

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,879
talked about Rodrigo but venicius Jr

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,440
carries this team a long way what a

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,920
player he is Terry you said it Mah I

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,039
have to say you talk about toall at the

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,079
beginning Jimmy and and what he offered

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,559
tactically in the first half and in the

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,399
second half didn't work uh in the first

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,680
half because they just didn't punish

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,840
them uh by scoring they did punish them

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,360
after that and what they offered in the

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,400
second half you know we will we will

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,880
talk about it uh after as you said Real

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,159
Madrid finds a way to stay in games to

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,960
to to to be in a situation where they

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,119
were struggling at the beginning of the

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,920
game they go one n up two one down they

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
don't panic they don't panic they know

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,159
they would have an opportunity and they

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,200
had one and we'll talk about it Jimmy I

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,640
know you you're going to talk about the

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,560
the way Bayern defended at times um

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
yeah we'll do that later but when you

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,399
actually look at the stats here I mean

42
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,600
Bayern are on top in every metric except

43
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,079
the goals and we said that before the

44
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,520
game you know and and that's why we'll

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,119
all probably be saying before the next

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,719
game they're the favorites to get to the

47
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,680
finals veryone welcome back everybody

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,439
good to have you with us here in our

49
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,719
studio in London that's your thing isn't

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,799
it Michael come on in welcome into the

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,399
studio it's so good to have you still

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,200
with us Kate tierry Jamie and Micah um

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,280
Micah talked about the fact that you

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,600
were interested in seeing how Bayern

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
would approach the game what did you

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,399
make of how they did approach the game

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
and like Micah said that the Tactical um

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,318
the Tactical change by Thomas to I

59
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:11,440
thought it was brilliant the way they

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,480
they they wanted to have the Wingers

61
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,800
inside having s almost as a 10 position

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
on the left and on other side having

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,400
musala as a 10 position on the right

64
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,680
trying to attract them with the fullback

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,720
and go back straight inside uh they they

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
they they cut them at the beginning they

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,760
just didn't they just didn't they do

68
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,360
finish the position also of Miller same

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
position he took against laio in between

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
the left Center back and the left back

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,959
to make sure that they were not going to

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
come and have an impact on those on the

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,120
position of the two10 and then they

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,920
switch it in the in the second half

75
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,000
having think the Wingers areon wide Geto

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,120
playing as a 10 inside to make sure they

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
were going to isolate those guys but

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,080
this time in an inverted manner the

79
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Lefty on the right the right player

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,560
white footed player sorry on the left

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
somebody just told me sorry that who was

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
showing whose notebook Micah you were

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
showing your notebook no because tiar G

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,599
some really good tactical an and his

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,040
position so I was just promp they saw it

86
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,200
on camera so they it was like Cru I tell

87
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,519
you it was an assist it was it was an

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,640
assist this show has come a long way

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,040
hasn't he Mikey Richard is telling t on

90
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,560
re about the tactics he reminded me

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,720
something I told

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,159
him he can't let you is that true true

93
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,080
or false it was nice nice I was just

94
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,040
saying it a really good point for mull I

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
just wanted to make sure you you

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
remember just putting Jimmy back to his

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Lane good teammate my who's going to the

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,879
L I'm going to me Lane yeah Lane go back

99
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,799
to your lane the lane tomorrow I tell

100
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,599
you else need to go back to their Lane

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,840
oh Kim the defender

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,680
y for Bayern Munich the reason Bayern

103
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,040
Munich are in have beat Arsenal is

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,519
because Arsenal had a defender in the

105
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,799
face leg K who was not at the level and

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,000
he cost him he cost Arsenal in that face

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,439
leg him has costed Bayern Munich in this

108
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,360
first leg he really has because they've

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,439
been the dominant team they've been the

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,560
better team but they've Le been let down

111
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,159
by a Defender at the back and that's

112
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,319
what happened to Arsenal and Bayon

113
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,000
obviously capitalized on that but Real

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,519
Madrid looked like they will capitalize

115
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,079
on this from Bayern Munich penalty for

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,839
each side between Real Madrid and Bayern

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,759
Munich uh was it a fair result did you

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,040
think michah did it reflect the game uh

119
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,240
I thought Bayern were the better team in

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
terms of the metrics like Jamie said you

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
know passes possession all that sort of

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
thing but it doesn't matter matter why

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,400
you looking at me like that

124
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,160
Jamie your case no you said the no I was

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
just laughing that you it didn't sound

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
you saying the Met just it didn't sound

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,960
right no I don't know just I don't know

128
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
it was my word wasn't it I was just

129
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,160
saying that you were but I think the

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,160
overall game basically Bayern overall

131
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,199
were probably the better team but Real

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,560
Madrid the dug in and got the draw in

133
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,160
the end Jamie anything to add the metrix

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,720
no I I agree with I agree with M you

135
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
know the metrics the stats whatever you

136
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,000
want to call them they were in Bay's

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,680
favor oh my God what does it mean in

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,880
terms of going into the second leg

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
because obviously I think we already

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,039
generally thought when you're thinking

141
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,280
of the tie across the two legs you

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,600
thought of Real Madrid as the favorites

143
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,840
has anything changed no and I I think

144
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,240
that'll really hurt Bayern Munich

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,039
tonight psychologically because they

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,080
were the better team and they played

147
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,520
really well and they still didn't win at

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
home and there's this feeling I think

149
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
with Real Madrid whoever comes up with

150
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
against them because I've written them

151
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,360
off so often Champions League final

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
against Liverpool I couldn't see how

153
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,919
they'd beat Liverpool but they beat them

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,600
beating Manchester City in the in the uh

155
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,919
in the last round a couple of years ago

156
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,160
beating Manchester City and you think

157
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,560
you're scratching your head thinking

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,680
how's it happen but they've done it

159
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,360
again in terms of getting a result here

160
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,800
uh I Would S the second leg goals but I

161
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,560
think for Bay to play so well as well as

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,280
they did and still not win the game I

163
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,759
mean I don't know how sort of you know

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,000
psychologically they'll be able to

165
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,639
believe they can go to sort of the B

166
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,840
about and get through you agree with

167
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,120
that tiar yeah I mean I mean we go back

168
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,000
to the same thing I said it the other

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
day doesn't matter who run the most who

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
had the most chances who had the the the

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
most most possession with Madrid is

172
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,599
about taking your chances and yes again

173
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,800
we're going to talk it's pretty obvious

174
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,120
you don't take your chances you don't do

175
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,560
much with what you have when you're on

176
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
the ball and that's up to you mad will

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,759
you know we can take the life Li game

178
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,080
and you look at it and you're like how

179
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,919
how s didn't score three our open that

180
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,520
didn't score three in Madrid you take

181
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,120
the man city game you're like oh they

182
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
didn't touch the ball well they score

183
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,160
four goals though three there and one

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
and so again today two yes you can say

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,919
if there's a lot of if at the end of the

186
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,840
day when he comes to Madrid there's a

187
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,360
lot of if all the time I've been in that

188
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,160
situation you're like okay you you play

189
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
against a big team you have them you

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
don't you don't they execute stuff

191
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,199
that's what they do that's why you have

192
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,479
14 14 uh um offic Champions Leagues um

193
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,199
well over there in Munich p schichel and

194
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,199
g and balag watch this game live for us

195
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,440
at the stadium over there let's find out

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,720
their thoughts what did you think jent

197
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,000
well do you know it's amazing when you

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
watch a game on TV and then you watch it

199
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,240
live how different you see the game so

200
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,560
what I'm hearing here is the studio

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
actually thought B Munich played really

202
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,599
really well I don't think they did I

203
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,240
think they were very slow in the first

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,520
half they made some tactical changes yes

205
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,000
and it was a little bit better in the

206
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,720
second half but weren't really

207
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,319
threatening anything and we were sat

208
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,000
there talking about well they up against

209
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,599
Real Madrid they will hit them back and

210
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,360
and you know being two one up they they

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,039
should be a bit disappointed Defender

212
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,560
Kim on the first goal I don't know what

213
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,080
Kim's doing I don't know why he's giving

214
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,879
that penalty away they could have won

215
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,199
but they didn't play well do you think

216
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,639
they play well quite clearly there were

217
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,599
periods 20 minutes in the first half and

218
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,319
15 20 minutes in the second half that

219
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
they you were asking them you were

220
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,039
asking Bayan to actually speed things up

221
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,680
and they did and when they did they got

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
a result I find fascinating what

223
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,080
happened in the first 20 minutes in

224
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,720
which Real Madrid were like doesn't

225
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,400
matter we inferior we're considering

226
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,720
goals we'll have our moment goal and in

227
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,599
the second half exactly the same they go

228
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,759
21 down doesn't matter we'll have our

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,720
chances and then eventually they come so

230
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,319
that's the that's the head it's amazing

231
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,639
to watch Real Madrid play live in the

232
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,039

with and you always sit there with a

238
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,479
sense of them striking back and of

239
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,560
course they did again again today and

240
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
