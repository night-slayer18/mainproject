occasion if I did not say thank you for

using your t-shirt wardrobe to

28

demonstrate to the world that male

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,840
sartorial elegance doesn't always

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,929
present itself in a suit tie and

31
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:57,319
cufflinks most importantly thank you for

you president Faust Board of Overseers

39
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,180
faculty friends alumni proud parents

I am honored to be here with you today

43
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,519
because let's face it you accomplished

44
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,959
something I never could if I get through

45
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,879
this speech today it'll be the first

46
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,680
time I actually finished something here

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,540
at Harvard class of 2017 congratulations

48
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,950
now I'm going to unlikely speaker today

49
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,420
not just because I dropped out but

50
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,280
because we're technically in the same

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,940
generation we walk this yard less than a

52
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,180
decade apart we studied the same ideas

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,890
and slept through the same act 10

54
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,920
lectures we may have taken different

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,409
roads to get here especially if you came

56
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,310
all the way from the quad but today I

57
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,230
want to share what I've learned about

58
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,349
our generation and the world we're all

59
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,400
building together but first these last

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,780
couple of days brought back a lot of

61
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,720
good memories how many of you remember

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,810
exactly where you were and what you were

63
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,790
doing when you got that email telling

64
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,220
you you got into Harvard

65
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,340
[Applause]

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,199
I was playing I was playing the video

67
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,590
games civilization and I ran downstairs

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,020
and got my dad and for some reason his

69
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,970
first reaction was to video me opening

70
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,460
the email that could have been a really

71
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,010
really sad video but I swear getting

72
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,040
into Harvard is the thing my parents are

73
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,770
most proud of me for my mom is nodding

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,840
you'll know what I'm talking about look

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,310
guys it's tough to beat this you'll see

76
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,610
when you get out there how many of you

77
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,340
remember your first lecture here at

78
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,010
Harvard mine was computer science 121

79
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,480
with the incredible Harry Lewis Harry I

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,150
[Applause]

81
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,610
was running late for class so I throw

82
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,620
out a t-shirt and I didn't realize until

83
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,690
afterwards I put it on inside out and

84
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,250
backwards my tag was sticking out the

85
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,190
front I couldn't figure out why no one

86
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,760
in class would talk to me except for

87
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,760
this one guy K X Gen he just went with

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,580
it we started doing our problem sets

89
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,080
together and now he runs a big part of

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,940
Facebook and that class of 2017 is why

91
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,400
you should be nice to people

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,230
[Laughter]

93
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,860
[Applause]

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,530
but my best memory from Harvard is

95
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:50,180
meeting Priscilla I had just launched

96
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,760
this prank website face mask and the ad

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,590
board wanted to see me everyone thought

98
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,139
I was going to get kicked out my parents

99
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,440
drove up here to help me pack my stuff

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,710
my friends threw me a going-away party

101
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,520
who does that

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,539
as luck would have it Priscilla was at

103
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,600
that party with her friends and we met

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
in line for the bathroom in the Fogo

105
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,130
bell tower and then what must be one of

106
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,229
the all-time most romantic lines I

107
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:26,960
turned her and said I'm getting kicked

108
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,610
out in three days so we need to go on to

109
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,590
date quickly actually any of you

110
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,500
graduating today can use that line I'm

111
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,150
getting kicked out today we need to go

112
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,099
on a date fast I didn't end up getting

113
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:46,210
kicked out I did that to myself

114
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,620
Priscilla and I started dating and you

115
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,990
know that movie made it seem like

116
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,060
Facemash was so important to starting

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,770
Facebook it wasn't but without say smash

118
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,099
I never would have met Priscilla and

119
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,330
Priscilla is the most important person

120
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,310
in my life

121
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,690
so you could still say it was the most

122
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,669
important thing I built in my time here

123
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,810
[Applause]

124
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,610
we have all started lifelong friendships

125
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,330
here and some of us even families that's

126
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,360
why I'm so grateful to this place

127
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:37,030
thanks Harvard today I want to talk

128
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,840
about purpose but I'm not here to give

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,490
you the standard commencement about

130
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,750
finding your purpose

131
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,569
we're Millennials we try to do that

132
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,469
instinctively instead I'm here to tell

133
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,530
you that finding your purpose isn't

134
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,530
enough the challenge for our generation

135
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,430
is to create a world where everyone has

136
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,750
a sense of purpose one of my favorite

137
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,319
stories is when JFK went to go visit the

138
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,629
NASA Space Center and he saw a janitor

139
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,610
holding a broom and he asked him what he

140
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,830
was doing and the janitor replied mr.

141
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,080
president I'm helping put a man on the

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,690
moon purpose is that feeling that you

143
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,430
are a part of something bigger than

144
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,789
yourself that you are needed and that

145
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,409
you have something better ahead to work

146
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,890
for purpose is what creates true

147
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,520
happiness and you are graduating at a

148
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,708
time when this is especially important

149
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,010
when our parents graduated that sense of

150
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,220
purpose reliably came from your job your

151
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,520
church your community but today

152
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,740
technology and automation are

153
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,980
eliminating many jobs membership in a

154
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,690
lot of communities has been declining

155
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,060
and a lot of people are feeling

156
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,070
disconnected and depressed and are

157
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,890
trying to fill a void in their lives as

158
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,040
I've traveled around I've sat with

159
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,420
children and juvenile detention and

160
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,240
opioid addicts who told me that maybe

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
their lives would have turned out

162
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
differently if they just had something

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,860
to do and after school program or

164
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,430
somewhere to go I've met factory workers

165
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,930
who know their old jobs aren't coming

166
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,060
back and we're just trying to find their

167
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,630
path ahead

168
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,400
for our society to keep moving forward

169
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,030
we have a generational challenge to not

170
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,490
only create new jobs but create a

171
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,370
renewed sense of purpose I remember that

172
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,250
night I launched Facebook from that

173
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,500
little dorm in Kirkland house I went to

174
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,730
Nokes with my friend kayaks and I

175
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,770
remember telling him clearly that I was

176
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,270
excited to help connect the Harvard

177
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,220
community but one day someone would

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,700
connect the whole world the thing is it

179
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,410
never even occurred to me that that

180
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,510
someone might be us we were just college

181
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,630
kids we didn't know anything about that

182
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,890
there are all these great big technology

183
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,990
companies with all these resources and I

184
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,360
just assumed one of them would do it but

185
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,150
this idea was so clear to us that all

186
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,060
people want to connect so we just kept

187
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,460
working on it day after day after day

188
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,670
and I know that a lot of you are going

189
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,500
to have your own stories just like this

190
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,530
a change in the world that seems so

191
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,650
clear that you are sure someone else is

192
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,630
going to do it but they're not you will

193
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,520
but it's not enough to have that purpose

194
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
yourself you also have to create a sense

195
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,880
of purpose for others and I found that

196
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
out the hard way you see my hope was

197
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,760
never to build a company I wanted to

198
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,550
have an impact and as all these people

199
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,830
started joining us I just assumed that

200
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,300
that's what they wanted to do too so I

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,700
never took the time to explain what it

202
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,910
was that I hoped we'd built a couple

203
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,310
years in some big companies wanted to

204
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,790
buy us I didn't want to sell I wanted to

205
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,290
see if we could connect more people and

206
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,480
we were building the first version of

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,550
newsfeed at the time and I thought if we

208
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,560
could just launch this it could change

209
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,250
how we all learn about the world nearly

210
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,210
everyone else wanted to sell without a

211
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,710
sense of higher purpose

212
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,810
this was their startup dream come true

213
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,530
and it tore our company apart after one

214
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,960
particularly tense argument one of my

215
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,400
closest advisors told me if I didn't

216
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,139
agree to sell the company right now

217
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,329
I would regret that decision for the

218
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:43,350
rest of my life relationships were so

219
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,379
afraid that within a year or so every

220
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,449
single person on our management team was

221
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,369
gone that was my hardest time meeting

222
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:56,910
Facebook I believed in what we were

223
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,959
doing but I felt alone and worse it was

224
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,290
my fault I wondered if I was just wrong

225
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,209
an impostor a 22 year old kid who had no

226
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:13,109
idea how things actually worked now

227
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:16,350
years later I understand it that is how

228
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,970
things work when there's no sense of

229
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,489
higher purpose so it's up to all of us

230
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,829
to create it so we can all keep moving

231
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,790
forward together and today I want to

232
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,579
talk about three ways that we can create

233
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,399
a world where everyone has a sense of

234
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,429
purpose by taking on big meaningful

235
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,439
projects together

236
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,989
by redefining equality so everyone has

237
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,269
the freedom to pursue their purpose and

238
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:45,179
by building community all across the

239
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,799
world so first let's take on big

240
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,489
meaningful projects our generation is

241
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:54,809
going to have to deal with tens of

242
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,549
millions of jobs replaced by automation

243
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,669
like self-driving cars and trucks but we

244
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,110
have the potential to do so much more

245
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,259
than that every generation has its

246
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,689
defining works more than three hundred

247
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:08,790
thousand people work to put that man on

248
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,160
the moon including that janitor millions

249
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,049
of volunteers immunize children around

250
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:15,149
the world against polio and millions of

251
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,189
more people built the Hoover Dam and

252
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,339
other great projects and now it's our

253
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,689
generations turn to do great things

254
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,189
now I know maybe you're thinking I don't

255
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,499
know how to build a dam I don't know how

256
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:29,730
to get a million people involved in

257
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,309
anything well let me tell you a secret

258
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:39,239
no one does when they begin ideas don't

259
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:42,660
come out fully formed they only become

260
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,569
clear as you work on them you just have

261
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:49,259
to get started if I had to know

262
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,700
everything about connecting people

263
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,160
before I got started I never would have

264
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,460
built Facebook movies and pop-culture

265
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,560
just get this all wrong

266
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,620
the idea of a single Eureka moment is a

267
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,530
dangerous lie it makes us feel

268
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,780
inadequate because we feel like we

269
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,900
haven't had ours yet and it prevents

270
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,700
people with seeds of good ideas from

271
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,290
ever getting started in the first place

272
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,680
oh and you know what else movies get

273
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,320
wrong about innovation no one writes

274
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,100
math formulas on glass okay all right

275
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:31,350
that's not a thing okay it's really good

276
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,820
to be idealistic but be prepared to be

277
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,420
misunderstood anyone working on a big

278
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,850
vision is going to get called crazy even

279
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,790
if you end up right anyone taking on a

280
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,430
complex problem is going to get blamed

281
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,260
for not fully understanding it even

282
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,190
though it's impossible to know

283
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,830
everything up front anyone taking

284
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,500
initiative will always get criticized

285
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,720
for moving too fast because there's

286
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,610
always someone who wants to slow you

287
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,590
down in our society we often don't take

288
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,300
on big things because we're so afraid of

289
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,000
making mistakes that we ignore all the

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,050
things wrong today if we do nothing the

291
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,850
reality is anything we do today is going

292
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,520
to have some issues in the future but

293
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,660
that can't stop us from getting started

294
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,860
so what are we waiting for

295
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,950
it is time for our generation defining

296
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,100
great works how about stopping climate

297
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,230
change before we destroy the planet and

298
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,500
getting millions of people involved

299
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,730
[Music]

300
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,410
manufacturing and installing solar

301
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,830
panels how about curing all diseases and

302
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,030
getting people involved by asking

303
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,370
volunteers to share their health data

304
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,990
track their health data and share their

305
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,620
genomes you know today our society

306
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,870
spends more than 50 times as much

307
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,570
treating people were sick as we invest

308
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,400
in finding cures so people get sick in

309
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,210
the first place

310
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,410
it makes no sense

311
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,160
we can fix this how about modernizing

312
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,320
democracy so everyone can vote online

313
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,220
and how about personalizing education so

314
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,820
everyone can learn these achievements

315
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,540
are all within our reach let's do them

316
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,850
all in a way that gives everyone in our

317
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,200
society a role let's do big things not

318
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,570
just to create progress but to create

319
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:42,530
purpose so taking on big meaningful

320
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,390
projects together is the first thing we

321
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,370
can do to create a world where everyone

322
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,080
has a sense of purpose

323
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,800
the second is redefining our idea of

324
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,340
equality so everyone has the freedom to

325
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,510
pursue their purpose now many of our

326
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,430
parents had stable jobs throughout their

327
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,290
careers but in order generation we're

328
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,970
all a little entrepreneurial whether

329
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,439
we're starting our own projects or

330
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,959
finding our role in another one and you

331
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,910
know that's great because our culture of

332
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,160
entrepreneurship is how we create so

333
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,449
much progress an entrepreneurial culture

334
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:20,449
thrives when it is easy to try lots of

335
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,810
new ideas Facebook wasn't the first

336
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,660
thing I built I also built chat systems

337
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,330
and games study tools and music players

338
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,460
and I'm not alone

339
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,550
JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before

340
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,170
she finally wrote and published Harry

341
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,280
Potter even Beyonce had to make hundreds

342
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,810
of songs to get Halo

343
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,380
the greatest successes come from having

344
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:57,300
the freedom to fail now today we have a

345
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,730
level of wealth inequality that hurts

346
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,870
everyone when you can't when you don't

347
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,260
have the freedom to take your idea and

348
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,380
turn it into a historic enterprise we

349
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,370
all lose and right now today our society

350
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,040
is way over indexed on rewarding people

351
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,140
when they're successful and we don't do

352
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,210
nearly enough to make sure that everyone

353
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,150
can take lots of different shots now

354
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,910
let's face it there is something wrong

355
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,730
with our system when I can leave here

356
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,010
and make billions of dollars in ten

357
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,710
years while millions of students can't

358
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,630
even afford to pay off their loans let

359
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:47,040
alone start a business look I know a lot

360
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,559
of entrepreneurs and I don't know a

361
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,200
single person who gave up on starting a

362
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,580
business because they were worried they

363
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,490
might not make enough money but I know

364
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,410
too many people who haven't had the

365
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,840
chance to pursue their dreams because

366
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,250
they didn't have a cushion to fall back

367
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:10,679
on if they failed we all know you don't

368
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,600
get successful just by having a good

369
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,540
idea or working hard you get successful

370
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,410
by being lucky - if I had to support my

371
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,240
family growing up instead of having the

372
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,760
time to learn how to code if I didn't

373
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,260
know that I was going to be fine

374
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,870
if Facebook didn't work out but I

375
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,929
wouldn't be standing up here today and

376
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,480
if we're honest we all know how much

377
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,280
luck we've had to get to this point in

378
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,700
our lives every generation expands its

379
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,980
definition of equality previous

380
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,840
generations fought for the vote and

381
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,710
civil rights they had the New Deal and

382
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,120
Great Society and now it's time for our

383
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,070
generation to define a new social

384
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,220
contract

385
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,280
we should have a society that measures

386
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,100
progress not just by economic metrics

387
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,320
like GDP but by how many of us have a

388
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,290
role we find meaningful we should

389
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,360
explore ideas like universal basic

390
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,920
income to make sure that everyone has a

391
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:23,460
cushion to try new ideas we're all going

392
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,560
to change jobs and roles many times so

393
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,330
we need affordable childcare to get to

394
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,250
work and healthcare that's not tied to

395
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,730
just one employer and we're all going to

396
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,950
make mistakes so we need a society

397
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,290
that's less focused on locking us up and

398
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,950
stigmatizing us when we do and as our

399
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,260
technology keeps on evolving we need a

400
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,000
society that is more focused on

401
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,220
providing continuous education through

402
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:58,470
our lives and yes giving everyone the

403
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,420
freedom to pursue purpose isn't going to

404
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,570
be free people like me should pay for it

405
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,060
and a lot of you are going to do really

406
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:16,980
well and you should too that is why

407
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,870
Priscilla and I started the Chan

408
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,910
Zuckerberg initiative and committed our

409
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,980
wealth to promoting equal opportunity

410
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,560
these are the values of our whole

411
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,860
generation it was never a question of if

412
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,870
we were going to do this the only

413
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,930
question was when Millennials are

414
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,460
already one of the most charitable

415
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,420
generations in history in just one year

416
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,940
more than three and four u.s.

417
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,370
Millennials donated to charity and more

418
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,050
than seven and ten raise money for

419
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,080
another one but it's not just about

420
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,730
giving money you can also give time and

421
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,100
I promise you if you just take an hour

422
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,800
to a week that's all it takes to give

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,450
someone a hand and help them reach their

424
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,380
potential now maybe you're thinking

425
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,640
that's a lot of time I'm not sure if I

426
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,260
have that much time I used to think that

427
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,640
you know when Priscilla graduated from

428
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,430
Harvard she became a teacher and before

429
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,860
she'd do education work with me she told

430
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,820
me that I needed to get my own

431
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,210
experience teaching a class at first I

432
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,560
complained you know I'm kind of busy

433
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,780
running this company but she insisted so

434
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,260
I taught an after-school program at the

435
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,790
local Boys and Girls Club on

436
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,140
entrepreneurship I taught those kids

437
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,330
lessons on product development and

438
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,000
marketing and they taught me what it was

439
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,490
like growing up feeling targeted for

440
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,270
your race and what it's like having a

441
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,650
family member in prison I shared stories

442
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,830
of my time in school and they shared

443
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,570
their hope that one day they would get

444
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:12,060
to go to college - for five years I've

445
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,430
had dinner with those students every

446
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,850
month one of them even through Priscilla

447
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,240
and me our first baby shower and next

448
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,310
year they're going to college every one

449
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,640
of them first-generation and their

450
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,870
families we can all make time to give

451
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,990
someone a hand let's give everyone the

452
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,270
freedom to pursue purpose not just

453
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,280
because it's the right thing to do but

454
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,299
because when more pee

455
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,859
can turn their dreams into something

456
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,479
great we are all better for it

457
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,799
purpose doesn't only come from work

458
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,229
the third way we can create a sense of

459
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:03,419
purpose for everyone is by building

460
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,139
community and in our generation when we

461
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,450
say purpose for everyone we mean

462
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,139
everyone in the world now quick show of

463
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,109
hands how many of you here are from

464
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:20,969
another country I now keep your hands up

465
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:23,609
how many of you are friends with one of

466
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:28,649
these folks now we're talking see we

467
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:33,239
have we have grown up connected in a

468
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,129
recent survey of Millennials around the

469
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:37,529
world asking what most defines our

470
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:40,320
identity the most popular answer wasn't

471
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,629
nationality ethnicity or religion

472
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:47,519
it was citizen of the world that's a big

473
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,079
deal every generation expands the circle

474
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,679
of people we consider one of us and in

475
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,200
our generation that now includes the

476
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,089
whole world we understand that the great

477
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:05,639
arc of human history bends towards

478
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,619
people coming together in ever greater

479
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,039
numbers from tribes to cities to nations

480
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,139
to achieve things that we could not on

481
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:15,959
our own we get that our greatest

482
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,779
opportunities are now global we can be

483
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,179
the generation that ends poverty that

484
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,299
ends disease and we get that our

485
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,559
greatest challenges need global

486
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,950
responses to no country can fight

487
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,109
climate change alone or prevent

488
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,589
pandemics progress now requires coming

489
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:37,019
together not just those cities or

490
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,839
Nations but also as a global community

491
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,270
but we live in an unstable time

492
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,460
there are people left behind by

493
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,450
globalization across the whole world and

494
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,800
it's tough to care about people in other

495
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,230
places well we don't first feel good

496
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,830
about our lives here at home there's

497
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,490
pressure to turn inwards this is the

498
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,150
struggle of our time the forces of

499
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,940
freedom openness and global community

500
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,450
against the forces of authoritarianism

501
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,450
isolationism and nationalism forces for

502
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,390
the flow of knowledge trade and

503
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,030
immigration against those who would slow

504
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,930
them down this is not a battle of

505
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,360
Nations is a battle of ideas there are

506
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,210
people in every country for more global

507
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,740
connection and there are good people

508
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,740
against it and this isn't going to be

509
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,950
decided at the UN either it's going to

510
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,770
happen at the local level when enough of

511
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,650
us feel a sense of purpose and stability

512
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,980
and our own lives that we can start to

513
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,900
open up and care about everyone else too

514
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,250
and the best way to do that is to start

515
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,920
building local communities right now

516
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,740
we all get a lot of meaning from our

517
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,650
communities who hears from Elliot house

518
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,920
how about Lowell I know you guys found

519
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,210
community because you literally live

520
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,570
right on top of each other and Mather

521
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,840
[Music]

522
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,280
I'll just leave that there whether our

523
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,460
communities are houses or sports teams

524
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,770
churches or acapella groups they give us

525
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,150
that sense that we were a part of

526
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,960
something bigger that we are not alone

527
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,820
they give us the strength to expand our

528
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,200
horizons and that's why it's so striking

529
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,450
that over the past few decades

530
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,800
membership in all kinds of communities

531
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
has declined by as much as one quarter

532
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,110
that's a lot of people who now need to

533
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,560
find a sense of purpose somewhere else

534
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,600
but I know that we can rebuild these

535
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,700
communities and start new ones because

536
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,110
many of you already are

537
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:14,380
I met Agnes ps-aguié who's graduating

538
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:21,970
today Agnes where are you Agnes spent

539
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,750
her childhood navigating conflict zones

540
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,480
with human trafficking in Uganda and now

541
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,160
she's trained thousands of law

542
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,540
enforcement officials to keep

543
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,350
communities safe

544
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,840
I met Kayla Oakley and Neha Jain

545
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,980
graduating today to stand up guys

546
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,730
Kayla Nia started a non-profit that

547
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,220
connects people suffering from chronic

548
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,690
illnesses with people in their

549
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,000
communities who are willing to help out

550
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,130
and I met David Rosner

551
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,600
who's graduating from the Kennedy School

552
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,340
today David stand up David is a former

553
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,430
city councilor who fought to make Mexico

554
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,040
City the first Latin American city to

555
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,440
pass marriage equality even before San

556
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:38,680
Francisco and this is my story - a

557
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,260
student in a dorm connecting one

558
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,020
community at a time and keeping at it

559
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,140
until one day we can connect the whole

560
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,250
world change starts local even global

561
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,010
change starts small with people like us

562
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,880
in our generation the struggle of

563
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,070
whether we connect more whether we

564
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,500
achieve our greatest opportunities comes

565
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,760
down to this your ability to build

566
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,700
communities and create a world where

567
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,820
every single person has a sense of

568
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,060
purpose

569
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,549
class of 2017 you are graduating into a

570
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,690
world that needs purpose and it's up to

571
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,400
you to create it now maybe you're asking

572
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,960
yourself can I really do this well

573
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,710
remember when I told you about that

574
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,179
class I taught at the Boys and Girls

575
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:54,530
Club one day after class I was talking

576
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,960
to my students about going to college

577
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,120
and one of my top students raised his

578
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,460
hand and said that he wasn't sure he

579
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,750
could go to college because he's

580
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,270
undocumented he wasn't sure if they'd

581
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,360
take him

582
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,710
last year I took him out to breakfast

583
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,160
for his birthday and I wanted to get him

584
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,929
a gift so I asked him what he wanted and

585
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:18,169
he just started talking about struggles

586
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,240
that he saw other students in this class

587
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,809
facing and finally said you know I'd

588
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,070
really just like a book on social

589
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:32,000
justice I was blown away here is a young

590
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,130
guy who has every reason to be cynical

591
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,470
he wasn't sure it's the country he calls

592
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,700
home the only one he's known was going

593
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,740
to deny him his dream of going to

594
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,940
college but he wasn't feeling sorry for

595
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,549
himself he wasn't even thinking of

596
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,240
himself he has a greater sense of

597
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,429
purpose and he is going to bring people

598
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:04,370
along with him it says something about

599
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,890
our situation today that I can't even

600
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,419
say his name because I don't want to put

601
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,750
him at risk

602
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,830
but if a high school senior who doesn't

603
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,230
know what the future holds for him can

604
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,170
do his part to move the world forward

605
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,390
then we owe it to the world to do our

606
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,260
part to

607
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,230
so before you walk out those gates one

608
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,720
last time

609
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,490
and as we sit here in front of Memorial

610
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,679
Church I'm reminded of a prayer

611
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,730
Misha Barak that I say whenever I face a

612
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,270
big challenge that I sing to my daughter

613
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,429
thinking of her future when I tuck her

614
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:17,980
in at night and it goes may the source

615
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,890
of strength whose blessed the ones

616
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,700
before us help us find the courage to

617
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,370
make our lives a blessing I hope you

618
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,340
find the courage to make your life a

619
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,610
blessing congratulations class of 2017

621
00:33:37,940 --> 00:34:39,179
[Applause]
